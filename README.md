## My process
i started with a mobile first workflow. i codded out the html then i added the css then i moved to the javscript to add the client
side validation. then i went ahead to add media queries for bigger screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i re-enforced my knowledge on client side form validation with javascript. then i learnt about adding a max width to your images in css to 
make it responsive.
```css
.img {
  max-width: 100%
}
```
